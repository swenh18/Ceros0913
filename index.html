<P>Hello,

<P>After thoroughly soaking up the Ceros experience - from the video ad to the thoroughly animated website - I realized I had no choice. I had to apply, I had to join! Creativity, engagement, innovation, and “life” (e.g., living over “dead” content) is what Ceros is all about, and that’s what I am about. Please allow me a shot at joining the sales team as a Business Development Representative.

<P>Here are four-reasons why I am a good fit for the BDR position:

<P>1. Passion
<br>Anyone joining Ceros needs to be passionate in general and have a passion for Ceros itself. This is because Ceros is about connecting through creativity and life, and passion is the source of both. I am passionate about Ceros because its values and its work inspires me.

<P>2. Curiosity
<br>Curiosity is the seed of creativity. Curiosity of people and products is what drives interest in clients and their needs as well as a general interest in problem solving.

<P>3. Growth-oriented
<br>I approach life and work with a growth-mindset. I am always striving to learn and seeking feedback for improvement. I even developed a system of categorizing my life into areas to document ideas for improving each.

<P>4. Creativity
<br>I have a knack for generating new ideas and approaching things unconventionally. I believe this will be of value for “unlocking creativity” in email campaigns. Furthermore, I promise you would not be hiring a guy like this

<P>but someone like this

<P>From Ceros’ values, services, culture, to its team of passionate creatives, Ceros is special. That’s why I would love to kickstart my sales career there as part of the team. Once aboard, I absolutely would give the BDR position my all - whether its developing prospect relationships, managing pipelines, or reaching out to prospective clients with creative emails.

<P>Thank you for the time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of joining in Ceros’ mission of moving the world from static content to meaningful content experiences.

<P>Best,
<br>Shi Wen

<P>P.S. Please excuse the style simplicity of this webpage due to my lack of coding skills. Ceros is about "idea to experiential content without code" anyway, right?
