Hello Elina (or alternative creative person at Ceros),

After thoroughly soaking up the Ceros experience - from the video ad to the website animated from head to toe - I realized I had no other choice. I had to apply, I had to join! Creativity, engagement, innovation, and “life” (e.g., living over “dead” content) is what Ceros is all about – and, that’s what I’m about. Please allow me a shot at joining the sales team as a Business Development Representative.

Here are four-reasons why I’m a good fit for the BDR position.

1. Passion
Anyone joining Ceros needs to be passionate in general and have a passion for Ceros itself. This is because Ceros is about connecting through creativity and life, and passion is the source of both. I am passionate about Ceros because its values and way of work resonates with my values and way of life

2. Curiosity
Curiosity is the seed of creativity. Curiosity of people and products is what drives interest in clients and their needs as well as a general interest in problem solving.

3. Growth-oriented
I approach life and work with a growth-mindset. I am always trying to learn and also striving for feedback for improvement. I even have a system of categorizing my life and documenting ideas for improvement. 

4. Creativity
I have a knack for generating new ideas and approaching things unconventionally. I believe this will be of value for “unlocking creativity” in email campaigns. I assure you would not be hiring this guy, but this guy.

From Ceros’ values, services, culture, to its team of passionate creatives, Ceros is special. I would love to launch my sales career at Ceros. That’s why if aboard the team, I absolutely would give the BDR position my all - whether its developing prospect relationships, managing pipelines, or reaching out to prospective clients with creative emails. 

Best,
Shi Wen
  
P.S..
Please excuse the simplicity of this webpage and my web coding skills. Ceros is about "idea to experiential content without code" anyway, right?
